# Multi-dimensional Unsteady State Heat Transfer (MATLAB)

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of modelling 2D unsteady state heat transfer. 3 scenarios are tested:

1. Transient Conduction With Convective Fluid Boundary Conditions.
2. Transient Conduction With Constant Temperature Boundary Conditions.
3. Lumped Parameter Analysis Heat Transfer.

A variety of different materials were chosen to evaluate the effect of thermal diffusivity and conductivity have on the transient temperature profile including:

1. Diamond
2. Polyvinylchloride Plastic (PVC)
3. Copper

More information including the numerical techniques used, interpretation, and results can be found in the following paper:
